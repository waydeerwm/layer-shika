## ‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN PROGRESS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Oh deer! ü¶å You've stumbled upon `layer-shika`, a rust library crate that provides a layer shell implementation for wayland compositors, using slint for the GUI. It allows you to create overlay windows and panels or bars that integrate seamlessly with wayland-based desktop environments.

Please note that this library is currently in early development and is not yet ready for production use.

## Current Status

May be not updated:

- The core functionality is under active development
- `femtovg` renderer
- Basic layer shell protocol support using `smithay-client-toolkit`, but this may change in future stable versions
- Partial support for pointer events
- Not all features are fully implemented or tested
- Documentation is incomplete or non-existent
- Examples are coming soon

It's recommended to wait for a stable release before using this library in any production projects. Development is trying to be as fast as a running skippy deer.

## Usage

Examples and usage instructions are coming soon. Hoping that they will not be too deer-ifying, like the current state of this library.

## Contributing

As the library is in a very early stage, it's recommended to open an issue to discuss ideas or proposed changes before submitting contributions. The project doesn't bite, it's not that kind of deer!
